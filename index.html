                    <p>Before you start building your website, it's essential to plan its structure, content, and purpose. 
                        Ask yourself: What is the main goal of my website? Who is my target audience? 
                        What features do I need to include? What is my budget for hosting and maintenance?</p>

                            When choosing a domain and web host, consider: availability of your desired domain name, 
                            reliability and uptime of the web host, storage space and bandwidth limitations,
